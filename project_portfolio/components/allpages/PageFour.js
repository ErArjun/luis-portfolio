        My journey started by me writing things that could be performed to
        an audience. In that journey, I stumbled upon magic which I
        instantly fell in love with and knew it is something I wanted to do.
        Since then magic is in my head 24/7 and the deck of cards never
        leaves my hand. Being called the finest sleight of hand artist of
        Nepal and given the responsibility to run Nepali Brotherhood of
        magician(which is the only organization dedicated to magician in
        Nepal) so quickly since I started magic, it gets me excited and also
        makes me feel responsible for the future of magic and live shows in
        Nepal.
