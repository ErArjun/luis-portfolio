          Luis's platform performances are for groups of 15 to 1,000 and can
          range from 10 to 70 minutes. David’s program is predominantly
          mentalism — mindreading, influence, predictions — magic that
          appeals to the savvy modern audience. His program is highly
          interactive, with countless audience members participating from
          their seat and the stage.
